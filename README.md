This project was made as the first public project to my github profile for others to see, it uses the google books API to get content and local storage to save it.

The main objectives was to have:

  1. A filter that the user can use to have certain books shown to then;
  2. The option to view details of certain book;
  3. The ability to add/remove said book to a list of favorites;
  4. The option to view all favorite books.

This project was created using the following technologies:
  
  1. TypeScript;
  2. React;
  3. Styled Components;
  4. Context API;
  5. React Router Dom.

To run the project in a local setting, first clone the repository and then download the dependencies with "npm i", then use "npm run start" to open the project in local host.
